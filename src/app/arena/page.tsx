// This file has been deprecated and its functionality moved to /src/app/(app)/arena/page.tsx.
// The content below has been removed to prevent Next.js from treating this as a page,
// which was causing a "parallel pages" build error.
//
// To fully clean up, you should:
// 1. Delete this file: /src/app/arena/page.tsx
// 2. Delete the directory and its contents: /src/app/arena/_components/
//
// No active code should be present in this file.

"use client"; // Kept to ensure it's treated as a client module if anything accidentally imports it.

// Original default export has been removed.
// For example: export default function ArenaPage() { ... } // <-- REMOVED

// console.log("This is /src/app/arena/page.tsx and it should be deleted.");
